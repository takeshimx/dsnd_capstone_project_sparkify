# DSND Capstone Project Sparkify

### Project Motivation
In this project, event data from Sparkify is analyzed to build a model for classifying existing and future users who are likely to churn, based on behaviors of two user groups who stayed and churned.
A web app is included, where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories.
